<h2>General Description</h2>

In this repository, you'll find the various programming projects I worked on
while at __McGill__ as either a Computer Engineering undergraduate or a Computer
Science graduate student.

I've included this `README` to list out all the programming projects I've
aggregated in this repository, and give a small summary for each one.
Each project has its own `README` that contains more details for either
installing, running or just understanding the project.

__Note:__ `COMP` and `ECSE` are part of course codes. `COMP` courses are offered by the School of Computer Science whereas `ECSE` courses are offered by the Faculty of Electrical, Computer and Software Engineering.

## ECSE489 DnsClient ![Java]()
This was a team project for a telecommunications and networking laboratory course. 
My teammate and I implemented a command line Domain Name Service (DNS) client in Java.
The client supports A, MX and NS query types.
